last file: _layout (tabs)

working on creating the highlight behind the tabs and the dynamic component to make every tab unique.

next: {/* // Movie grid, Movie Card component, Api to fetch movies, customhook maybe. */}


// last thing i worked on was details page.
made it where i can click on a movie image and it directs you to a new screen with the movie details on it. 
i had to create a usestate along with a new api fetch function that uses the id from the movie to find the movie and their details.

// Stylize the details page to make it look nice. add images. details. overview. etc

// struggled a little bit with arguments and types gave me a few issues, but you can use <Link href='movies'> to make dynamaic pages for each page without needing a bunch which is neat.
// i can see how a hook could be usefull. it runs the fetch without needing usestates everywhere along with needing only one fetch function instead of multiple like im 
using right now. but for practice sake keep using ugly code.

// next i need to make the search function work. it shuold take you to the search tab and filter the results on the page. (seems like it could be hard idk)

// finish up details page :D

// sync up the home page search and the search page search query.
